# Hospital-Management-System Implemented using PHP, CSS, Javascript, MySQL
The hospital management system aims to address several challenges in managing medical records, appointments, and prescriptions efficiently. Some of the key problems include the lack of a systematic approach to patient registration, prescription recording, and medicine inventory management. Without proper records and efficient systems, the hospital faces difficulties in delivering quality healthcare services and ensuring a seamless experience for patients.

The proposed system aims to improve patient care, enhance hospital operations, and ensure that accurate and comprehensive medical records are maintained. This will contribute to a more efficient and reliable healthcare service, benefiting both patients and hospital staff.
